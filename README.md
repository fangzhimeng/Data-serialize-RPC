# Data Serialize

**Protobuf** 

   - Is a language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible way of serializing structured data for use in communications protocols, data storage, and more.
   
   - Is a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler.
   
   - Define message structures in .proto files.
   - Generate codes via commandline:
    
   ```
   protoc --java_out=java sample.proto 
   ```

***Why should use Protobuf instead of XML or Json***

- ***XML*** is notoriously space intensive, and encoding/decoding it can impose a huge performance penalty on applications. Also, navigating an XML DOM tree is considerably more complicated than navigating simple fields in a class normally would be.

- ***Json*** is suitable when server side application is written in JavaScript, data from the service is directly consumed by a web browser.

**MessagePack** 

***MessagePack*** is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. Small integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.

**Kryo** 

***Kryo***is a fast and efficient binary object graph serialization framework for Java. The goals of the project are high speed, low size, and an easy to use API. The project is useful any time objects need to be persisted, whether to a file, database, or over the network.

Kryo can also perform automatic deep and shallow copying/cloning. This is direct copying from object to object, not object to bytes to object.

**Cap'n Proto**

***Cap'n Proto*** is an insanely fast data interchange format and capability-based RPC system. Think JSON, except binary. Or think Protocol Buffers, except faster. In fact, in benchmarks, Cap’n Proto is INFINITY TIMES faster than Protocol Buffers.

**Apache Thrift** forms a remote procedure call (RPC) framework, originally developed by the Facebook development team and is currently maintained by Apache. Mainly focuses on the communication layer between components of your system.

Thrift uses a special Interface Description Language (IDL) to define data types and service interfaces which are stored as ***.thrift*** files and used later as input by the compiler for generating the source code of client and server software that communicate over different programming languages.

Usage via maven:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.thrift</groupId>
    <artifactId>libthrift</artifactId>
    <version>0.10.0</version>
</dependency>
```
  - **Interface Description Language** is a specification language used to describe a software component's application programming interface (API). IDLs describe an interface in a language-independent way, enabling communication between software components that do not share one language.
  - **Base Types**
    - bool – a boolean value (true or false)
    - byte – an 8-bit signed integer
    - i16 – a 16-bit signed integer
    - i32 – a 32-bit signed integer
    - i64 – a 64-bit signed integer
    - double – a 64-bit floating point number
    - string – a text string encoded using UTF-8 encoding
  - **Special Types** 
    - binary – a sequence of unencoded bytes
    - optional – a Java 8’s Optional type
  - **Structs** are the equivalent of classes in OOP languages but without inheritance. A struct has a set of strongly typed fields, each with a unique name as an identifier. Fields may have various annotations (numeric field IDs, optional default values, etc.).
  - **Thrift containers** are strongly typed containers:
    - List – an ordered list of elements
    - set – an unordered set of unique elements
    - map<type1,type2> – a map of strictly unique keys to values
    - Container elements may be of any valid Thrift type.
  - **Exceptions** are functionally equivalent to structs, except that they inherit from the native exceptions.
  - **Services** are actually communication interfaces defined using Thrift types. They consist of a set of named functions, each with a list of parameters and a return type.

***Notes***

Commandline: 
``` 
thrift --gen <language> <Thrift filename> 
```

**GRPC** is RPC framework, using protocol buffers as both its Interface Definition Language (IDL) and as its underlying message interchange format.
